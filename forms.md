# Forms

Form is a document with blank spaces designated for the insertion and collection of data. The form’s biggest goal as well as difficulty is is to convey data clearly and collect data in a consistent and accessible manner. A well-designed form will keep consistent relationship between the information and the blank spaces where information needs to be populated and will keep logical and simple information hierarchy.

It is important to keep the boxed elements on an harmonic grid, keeping the visual noise to a minimum. Typeface should be visually pleasant, anything between 11 to 14 points, with 12 being the ideal size. Information hierarchy is of the highest importance in forms yet mustn’t clatter it, simply bold would be sufficient to indicate areas requiring bigger attention.
