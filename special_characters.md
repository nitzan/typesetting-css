# Special Characters

There are very specific instructions for the application and the spacing involved when using special characters. One of the more common special characters are the quotes. When citing text thin spaces should always be placed between opening quotes and the first word. When the quotes are used for setting display type, i.e. any type set over 18 pt, it is recommended to set them marks in the margins, and not as part of the line. When setting those there is a visual effect that often makes the marks look unduly big, so it is common to set those two sizes smaller than the typeface. However when quotation marks are used within body text it advised to keep them in the same size as the typeface as well keeping them within the line and not in the marginal space.

Spacing of italic type is more elaborate and different from the one of roman type. Whereas roman type usually requires even spacing, due to the nature of the varying kerning, italic text would often need adjustments to be made to keep with a consistently pleasant flow of text. The type of the spacing to be used varies on the typeface used and the individual letters in the beginning and the end of the word.
