# Abstract

*This is an excerpt from a research conducted into the work of the metal typesetter, and the potential relevance of it to modern digital typesetting (for screen).
*

The method was summary and comparison. Through secondary research into the subject of metal typesetting I tried to simplify the work of the typesetter and create a set of rules. 

I was hoping that cross comparison with open source CSS frameworks was going to yield a set of conclusions, that could start a conversation about best practices. Due to the rapid changes in CSS standards, languages and tools, this summary will focus on the first part of the paper (metal typesetting), without including the latter.
