# Word Spacing

[Steer](http://www.rookebooks.com/product?prod_id=36759) (1947, p.185) recommends a spacing of one and a half to two times the linear width of the lower-case alphabet of type selected. Too much spacing between words mars the looks of otherwise coherent piece of print. When word-spacing exceeds the correct measure light is let in where it is not wanted and the wide rivers of white space distracts the reader and make reading difficult.

Swann expands on the various physical elements that a typeface system contains. The Em space is a square unit of vertical body point size, En is exact half of that, three thick units are equal to one En, four Mid units equal to one em and and five Thins equal to one Em. The hair space is meant to be exactly twelve to the Em but realistically it come in various sizes and can anything between 1 to 3 pt.

The issue of correct spacing is a tool typographers could use to align text nicely and to avoid orphans, widows, hyphenation and generally non-pleasant text. As such this was considered to be a skill the typographer would need to master, a process that would often involve very meticulous work.

Steer shares some light on some of this aspect of the work of the typesetter.

- Spacing in short measures tends to be awkward due to the use of too large of a type
- The proportion of spacing between letters and words is not linear as the size of the typeface increases and thus the typographer will need to consider the typeface against the needed spacing and maximizing the legibility of the text.
- commas and full point are equivalent to a word-space

Some letters hold a significant amount of white space within them that can be used to save spaces and subsequently create more pleasant layouts.

Breaks in a word at the end of the line may be used occasionally, preferably after the first syllable. However if it is required to use break within the word in order to avoid a bad break in the line, the body text should return immediately to the normal standard. Even space between all words is desirable then, it is unacceptable to have thin space on one side and a bigger one of the other. That said, it is common to allow bigger spacing when a sentence is finished and in the same line a new one begins.

All punctuation marks should be within the line if possible. Which is to say that copy that consists of dash or a comma that ought to be placed within a line and not ‘sticking out’ at the end of it.
