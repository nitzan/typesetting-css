# Leading

Line-spacing, also known as leading is very important in determining the readability of a piece of text. It can be used by the typographer to balance too long of a line or typeface printed in less than legible color balance.

- The longer the line is the more more leading it needs
- The lighter a typeface is, the more leading it needs to be kept legible

The leading required to keep composition legible is not only determined by the outer space of the lines but also by the internal white space of letters. Typographers often use leading as a measure to decide control the ‘color’ of their text. The smaller the text, less leading it needs and the actual color of the composition would turn darker.

> The typesetter has a vast array of tools at their disposal to create harmonic compositions however he is reminded that over-formatting is one of his biggest enemies. Using too much spacing for letters, words or lines (leading) would mars even the most pleasant of compositions.
