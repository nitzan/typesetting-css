# Visual Order
Text must be broken up to manageable chunks so that the reader will be able to follow comfortably. The most common way of separating body text is to break up ideas into paragraphs.

The typesetter can also use an indent, a space at the beginning of a sentence, or a line break. It is not advisable to indent the first line of the page, especially if it follows a header. It is important to not join both methods of paragraph indication, that is to say that when you use a line break, an indent is redundant. The width of an indent can range from 1 to 3 em and it depends greatly on the width of the columns it is used in.

Another way of indicating a new paragraph is setting the first word, or number of, in bold, italic, all caps or small caps, this technique is called Lead-ins.

When body text includes lengthy quotations and cited text, for example in some academic material, these should be set in smaller point size, with less leading and across a narrower column, separated with a line break before and after the text. These are often referred to as extracts. As the text is set to contrast the body text by size and visual rhythm there is no need to use quotations. Indent is not necessary in the extract nor in the beginning of the paragraph to follow as the text is already visually differentiated from the body text and the paragraphs surrounding it.
