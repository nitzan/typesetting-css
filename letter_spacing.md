# Letter Spacing

The spacing of letters was a debatable tool typographers could utilize to increase the contrast of a certain word, as when the spacing is increased the amount of ink the word is painted with is smaller and thus the word appears lighter compared to other ones within the same line. This could be used to empathize, distinguish as well as separate certain words. When letter spacing is put into place, the common practice is to place any spacing bigger that a hair space, as mechanically, it was very thin and tended to break when places between letters. Other than that, the more common use of letter spacing was in setting words in capitals and small caps. In small caps it is rare to have the need to letter space as there is sufficient variety in shapes to generate easily distinguishable line of text. In upper case however, the letters often need to be manually spaced in order to allow pleasant reading.

Letter spacing should be dealt with caution, as appearance of some typefaces can be ruined by the excessive spacing. Even when separating display text which is set in small caps it is important to be aware of the subtleties of the typeface used and the ratio between the white
and black space.

According to Moye body text under 18 points neednâ€™t be kerned. He believes that the matter of spacing and the relation between white space and the body of the latter is being carefully examined by the designer of the typeface, thus the convention that there should not be any manual change in letter-spacing under under 18 point.
