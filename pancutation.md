# Pancutation

The use of punctuation should be kept to a minimum and only be applied when it contributes to the understanding of the text.

- Full points are not necessary after well-known abbreviations
- such as Mr, Mrs
- In abbreviated qualifications the last full point will be omitted, i.e. M.S.I.A
- Full points in abbreviations may be excluded entirely where qualifications are not likely to be confused
- Single quotation marks are sufficient to indicate speech or cited text
- Where cited text is italic or in smaller size quotation marks are not necessary at all
- Instead of em dash the en dash needs to be used followed by a word space
