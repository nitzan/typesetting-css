# Orphans and Widows

A paragraph mustnâ€™t end with one syllable of a word, as this type of composition is known to be very unpleasant to read, and is referred to as an orphan. 

In addition a page should not contain only one line. That is referred to as a widow. The typesetter had the freedom to advice changes to the copy that would enhance the visual consistency of the end result.
